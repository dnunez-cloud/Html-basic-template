        <p class="paragraph">
            The history of the people of this land is that of repression, of colonialism, and of being ruled and looted by foreign forces. So, their struggle for liberation and self-rule was something that was the most sought after.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            While many leaders emerged and fought for this cause, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was the one who ultimately inspired, mobilised, and led the people in snatching independence from the last of their rulers -- the then West Pakistani junta. The Pakistanis discriminated against the Bangalee nation and dominated them in all possible terms, be it political, economic or cultural.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Yesterday was the birth centenary of the great leader and also the National Children's Day. This year is special because the nation is celebrating the golden jubilee of its independence.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            To mark the occasion, the government has taken up a 10-day celebration programme, under the title Mujib Chirantan (Eternal Mujib). The country went into a festive mood with the celebrations beginning yesterday in the presence of foreign dignitaries.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            It started with the musical item "Anandaloke, Mongolaloke Birajo Sotto Sundaro…" around 4:30pm, performed by 100 children at the National Parade Square at the capital's Tejgaon, which was decorated with colourful billboards welcoming the foreign dignitaries.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-right">
            As the children performed patriotic songs, an animated film on Bangabandhu was screened at the venue. Earlier, President Abdul Hamid, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the Maldives President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih and his wife First Lady Madam Fazna Ahmed, and Sheikh Rehana, daughter of Bangabandhu, and National Professor Rafiqul Islam took seats on the stage after being invited by cultural personality and former minister Asaduzzaman Noor.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-right">
            Verses from the holy books -- the Quran, the Geeta, the Tripitaka and the Bible were read.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-right">
            "Ebarer Sangram, Amader Muktir Sangram; Ebarer Sangram, 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Swadhinatar Sangram" -- the historic call of Bangabandhu for emancipation was being played through loudspeakers, reminding the audience of the unequivocal call for independence of Bangladesh.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Eminent musicians sang "Tumi Banglar Dhrubo Tara, Tumi Hridoyer Batighar" [you are the polar star of Bangla and you are the lighthouse of heart], the theme song of the programme, written by poet Kamal Chowdhury and composed by Nakib Khan.

            A video of Bangladesh Air Force places in formation in the shape of "100" was also screened, leaving the audience, which included cabinet ministers, government officials and foreign diplomats, impressed. The event was limited to people due to the pandemic.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-left">
            Chinese President Xi Jinping, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Japanese counterpart Yoshihide Suga
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            delivered video messages addressing the people of Bangladesh on the occasion.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Presiding over the inaugural event, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said, "On this day in 1920, a child was born in a secluded village of Tungipara. The child, who came to this earth enlightening the lap of mother Sheikh Sayera Khatun and father Sheikh Lutfur Rahman, illuminated the life of the Bangalees and brought them freedom."
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            She said the freedom of the country came as a result of the continuous struggle initiated by Bangabandhu on March 11, 1948, with the ultimate target of political-economic and cultural emancipation of the Bangalees.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            "It was a war-ravaged country, which was under hundreds of years of subjugation. In just three and a half years, he carried out the mammoth task of building a fully-fledged sovereign state where people were suffering from exploitation, deprivation, hunger, and poverty.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman had done many things which seemed impossible, Hasina said, expressing sincere gratitude to all the friendly countries and leaders who extended necessary help during the Liberation War and post-war reconstruction of the country.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            She said Bangladesh is going to celebrate the birth centenary of the Father of the Nation and the golden jubilee of independence at a time when the country is well on track to graduate from the LDC status to that of a&nbsp; developing nation.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            She stated that the country's per capita income has exceeded $2,000; the poverty rate has declined below 20.5 percent; the country has become self-sufficient in food grain production and the average life expectancy has increased to 73 years.

        <p class="paragraph">
            Hasina warned about the active threat of "anti-Bangladesh forces" both at home and abroad, saying, "They want to disparage this achievement through various malpractices.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            "On the birthday of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib, let us, in a united manner, resist all evil-sprouts and take the beloved motherland forward towards the path of development and progress.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            "Now it's time to move forward. There is no chance to look behind. Overcoming all obstacles, we shall establish this country as Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's exploitation-free, deprivation-free, hunger-free, poverty-free, illiteracy-free, non-communal Golden Bangladesh."
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Addressing the event, National Prof Rafiqul Islam said the Bangalees were an unfortunate nation, and their bitter experiences are unforgettable. The nation had always been under the foreign rulers and looters.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            "To rid the nation of foreign rule, one leader was born. He is no other than Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who throughout his life fought for the oppressed people," he said.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Bangabandhu had to sacrifice his own life and that of most of his family members in a military coup on August 15, 1975.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            "However, today he remains immortal. His most important contribution is an independent country, liberation from the curse of slavery. We are indebted to him forever," Prof Rafiqul Islam said.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Today, Bangladesh is advancing in an irresistible speed, he said, adding that the theme of yesterday's event, therefore, has been set as "Bhengechhe Duar, Eshechche Jyotirmoy, Tomari Hok Joy".
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            &nbsp;British Journalist Sir Mark Tully, BBC's Indian affairs correspondent in 1971, who covered Bangladesh's Liberation War, in his recorded video message said he shared to the world the pain and anguish of the Bangalees during that time.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Now that the country is advancing, he rejoices in the celebrations. Tully recalled the memories of Bangabandhu, saying he was a great leader as well as very affectionate as a human being.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            He congratulated Bangladeshis and the leadership for the progress it made over the decades.
        </p>
